# MymediaLite_Python

This recommendation framework is the Python version of MyMediaLite and only integrates the WRMF model temporarily.

Run this program is easy, just run main.py and you can obtain the metrics of WRMF in the given parameters (of course you need to install the basic package like numpy and scipy).

You can change the training and test file into your own files and tune parameters to run your own recommendation methods.
